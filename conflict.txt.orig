Merge conflicts in git happen, when two branches were changed on the same line or in the same content of a file before a merge. If you just extend a file or append something, git usually just figures it out by itself.

In this post I present the development model that I’ve introduced for some of my projects (both at work and private) about a year ago, and which has turned out to be very successful. I’ve been meaning to write about it for a while now, but I’ve never really found the time to do so thoroughly, until now. I won’t talk about any of the projects’ details, merely about the branching strategy and release management.
